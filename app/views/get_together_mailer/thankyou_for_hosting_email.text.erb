Dear <%= @event.host.first_name ? @event.host.first_name : "Friend" %>,


Congratulations in creating your GetTogether!

You have done 99% of the work.
Now you simply have to *** confirm your event by following this link: <%= confirm_events_url(:cd => @event.confirmation_code) %> *** which will make your newly created event public to other GetUp members!



Thank you for all you do,

The GetUp team
