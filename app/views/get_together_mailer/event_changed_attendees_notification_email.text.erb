Dear Friend,

The event "<%= @event.name %>" you had registered to go to has changed.
Please note the new details:

EVENT NAME:    <%= @event.name %>
DATE: **<%= I18n.localize(@event.date).to_date.to_s(:long) %>**
TIME: **<%= @event.time_str %>**
EVENT ADDRESS: <%= @event.address %>
NOTES: <%= @event.host_notes %>

You can view all the details of your event on the following link: <%= event_url(@event.friendly_id) %>. 


Thanks for all you do,
The GetUp! team
