Dear <%= @event.host.first_name ? @event.host.first_name : "Friend" %>,

Your event "<%= @event.name %>" is now canceled.

<% if @event.attendees.count >0 %>
Your attendees have been notified by email.
<% end %>

Whatever your reasons for cancelling your event were, you can still create a new one here: <%= get_together_url(@event.get_together.friendly_id) %>

Thanks for all you do,
The GetUp! team
