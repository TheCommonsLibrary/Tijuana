Hi <%= @greeting %>, 

Welcome back to GetUp! Looks like you haven’t been in touch with us in little while, so it’s great to have you back onboard.

Maybe you've taken action on a GetUp campaign ( http://www.getup.org.au ), or supported a great cause on CommunityRun ( http://www.communityrun.org ). However you’ve reconnected, we’re glad you did!

You can also check out the latest from GetUp on Twitter ( https://twitter.com/GetUp ) and Facebook ( https://www.facebook.com/GetUpAustralia ), and sign up to hear about member-driven campaigns on CommunityRun's Facebook page or Twitter feed.

We’re just sending this to let you know that you’ve officially resubscribed to our mailing list. If this was done in error, you can click here to unsubscribe ( https://www.getup.org.au/unsubscribe ). We’d miss you, but we hope you'll keep an eye on our campaigns and take action on the issues that matter to you.

Thanks for being a part of this,

The GetUp! Team
