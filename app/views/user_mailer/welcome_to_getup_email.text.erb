Hi <%= @greeting %>, 

We'd like to say welcome! 

Maybe you've taken action on a GetUp campaign ( http://www.getup.org.au ), or supported a great cause on CommunityRun ( http://www.communityrun.org ). However you found us, we're glad you did!

Being a part of the community means that we'll email you every now and again with campaign updates on a range of issues - some of which you might be passionate about, and others you may not. Getting involved is quick, easy, effective and optional.

Now that you're here, let's get together.

Tell us which campaigns matter most to you in our new member survey: http://surveys.getup.org.au/s3/new-members

Check out the latest from GetUp on Twitter or Facebook, and sign up to hear about member-driven campaigns on CommunityRun's Facebook page or Twitter feed.

If you do just one thing, reply to this email. This will make sure our emails get to you in the future - and we'd also just love to hear from you.

Thanks for being a part of this, 

The GetUp! Team
